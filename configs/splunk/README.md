This folder, located within our config folder, is for how Splunk ingests, labels, and interprets logs.

Splunk works as the aggregator of the collected, centralized, and analyzed logs from multiple sources if has been configured to pull from, which include Sysmon ( a Windows-based system monitoring application that generates security specific logs within Event Viewer), firewalls and servers. Splunk serves at the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform.

The way I’ve learned to understand how this application works in conjunction with Sysmon is through an analogy is: Sysmon and the other serving data sources are like the different areas within our brain that are responsible for holding specific types od infromation. Zooming out and taking a collective approach, the brain as a whole (Splunk) works to capture all the information, sychronize that data, interpret that data, placing it under an aggregated and automated process that puts it all together into actionable intelligence that we can then use for informed decision making.
