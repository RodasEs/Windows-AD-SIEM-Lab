*Self-note:
What this is:
The threat narrative, ,eamomg what is it that we are trying to catch
What telemetry I will collect ( Sysmon + Windows logs)
What SIEM I used: (Splunk)
What detections I have configured and built
What kind of cases I have investigated
And what are the type of logs that I will intentionally ignore (noise)*

# Windows-AD-SIEM-Lab

Goal: Demonstrate Security+ log monitoring and detection concepts by building a small Active Directory and SIEM environment using free tools.

To generate endpoint + AD identity telemtry, ingest it into our SIEM platform, which in this case will be Splunk, then write detetions with tuning guidance, and then document investigations like real-life incident cases
